# vhdl-lightgame
A lightgame similiar to the game "Stacker". Only without stacking

# Function

## led_behavior
The leds should switch the anode in a specific speed which is defined in the lighgame.vhdl

# TODO
- [x] Determate target LED
- ~~[x]~~ Signalize win

  Wrong thinking. Wont work as intended.
  
- [ ] Check if LED was hit

  Testing still needs to be done
